										<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
										<p>This project is my engineering capstone project at Wake Forest University. There 5 students (including me) developing the algorithm, 
											as well as input from technical & non-technical experts such as computer science professors, 
											image processing experts, and an agile coach. Our team utilizes an <b>agile framework to structure the development 
											and delivery of our system</b>. As the <b>project manager</b>, I facilitate and document weekly team meetings within the 
											team (i.e. the 5 students developing this algorithm) in addition to biweekly meetings with faculty coaches, and 
											monthly meetings with the client, technical experts, and other key stakeholders.</p>

										<p>Appendiceal cancer (AC) is an extremely rare type of cancer with a variety of subtypes that require very different 
											treatment options. As a result of the rarity of this cancer type, very few hospitals receive patients with this particular 
											disease therefore, there are not many pathologists that develop the expertise in classifying these subtypes. This lack of 
											expertise creates this difficulty in the categorization of AC, yielding a high misdiagnosis rate of approximately 49%. 
											Furthermore, the treatment options for AC differs with respect to the subtype so it is necessary that patients are correctly 
											diagnosed to ensure patients receive the appropriate treatment.</p>

										<p>Wake Forest Baptist Health is in a unique position where the institution receives many patients with AC because it is one 
											of the biggest centers in North America that manages diagnosis and prognosis for this cancer type. Our client, an oncological 
											surgeon at Baptist Health, approached WFU Engineering with a capstone project proposal of implementing a machine learning algorithm 
											that can categorize whole slide images of AC specimens according to their subtypes. Since the 1990s, Baptist Health has been 
											storing de-identified AC specimens and wants my team to make use of the data to lower the rate of misdiagnosis.</p>
										
										<h3>Purpose</h3>
										<blockquote>Our team will lay the foundations for this project that will continue long after we have graduated. Our goal is 
											to develop and implement a ‘proof of concept’ with the purpose of demonstrating that our system can produce results with 
											a lower misdiagnosis rate than the rate of the current approach of 49%.</blockquote>
