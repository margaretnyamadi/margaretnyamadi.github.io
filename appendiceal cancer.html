										<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
										<p>This project is my engineering capstone project at Wake Forest University. There are 5 students (including me) developing the algorithm, 
											as well as input from technical & non-technical experts such as computer science professors, 
											image processing experts, and an agile coach. Our team utilizes an <b>agile framework to structure the development 
											and delivery of our system</b>. Besides developing the algorithm, as the <b>project manager</b> of the team, I also facilitate and document 
											weekly team meetings within the team (i.e. the 5 students) in addition to biweekly meetings with faculty coaches, and 
											monthly meetings with the client, technical experts, and other key stakeholders.</p>

										<p>Appendiceal cancer (AC) is an extremely rare type of cancer with a variety of subtypes that require very different 
											treatment options. As a result of the rarity of this cancer type, very few hospitals receive patients with this particular 
											disease therefore, there are not many pathologists that develop the expertise in classifying these subtypes. This lack of 
											expertise creates this difficulty in the categorization of AC, yielding a high misdiagnosis rate of approximately 49%. 
											Furthermore, the treatment options for AC differs with respect to the subtype so it is necessary that patients are correctly 
											diagnosed to ensure patients receive the appropriate treatment.</p>

										<p>Wake Forest Baptist Health is in a unique position where the institution receives many patients with AC because it is one 
											of the biggest centers in North America that manages diagnosis and prognosis for this cancer type. Our client, an oncological 
											surgeon at Baptist Health, approached WFU Engineering with a capstone project proposal of implementing a machine learning algorithm 
											that can categorize whole slide images of AC specimens according to their subtypes. Since the 1990s, Baptist Health has been 
											storing de-identified AC specimens and wants my team to make use of the data to lower the rate of misdiagnosis.</p>
										
										<h3>Purpose</h3>
										<blockquote>Our team will lay the foundations for this project that will continue long after we have graduated. Our goal is 
											to develop and implement a ‘proof of concept’ with the purpose of demonstrating that our system can produce results with 
											a lower misdiagnosis rate than the rate of the current approach of 49%.</blockquote>

											<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ac subtype visual.png" alt="ac subtypes" width="600"/></span> Our team spent the first 
												semester researching Appendiceal cancer and learning all we could about deep learning and its application in the medical diagnosis 
												of other cancers such as breast cancer. Prior to this project, none of our team members had any real world experience with any deep 
												learning algorithms or appendiceal cancer. Our team spent the first semester researching appendiceal cancer and learning all we could 
												about deep learning and its application in the medical diagnosis by benchmarking the algorithms used by other research groups for cancers 
												such as breast cancer and lung cancer. </p>
											<p> There were some challenges we faced during our research of AC but the main problem we encountered was that there was no ubiquitous
												 standardized classification of AC subtypes. The various research papers and medical institutions we reviewed had varying classification 
												 systems they used which made it difficult for us to use one standard system. There was as little as 3 subtypes to as many as 10 subtypes
												 depending on what paper I was looking at. Furthermore, the naming conventions of AC subtypes eveolved overtime as researchers deliberated
												 on whether certain subtypes should be classified under other sutypes. To rectify this problem, I researched the World Health Organization's 
												 (WHO) most recent classification system to serve as the foundation of the classification system our team would use. </p>
