										<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/mof.png" alt="MOF" height="400"/></span>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are currently 
											under intense focus and study in relation to greenhouse gases because they have an exceptionally high surface area and a high capacity for 
											storing gases. MOFs have the ability to selectively absorb gases into pockets of space within its structure, and therefore are extremely 
											useful in isolating and capturing certain gases. The MOF used in this research is UiO-66 and UiO-66 functionalized with 
											<i>NH<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>NO<sub>2</sub></i> .</p>

										<p>A large majority of research groups calculate heats of adsorption by differentiating isotherm collected at multiple 
											temperatures. This is an indirect method for determining heats of adsorption that can result in erroneous values particularly 
											at low adsorbate coverages. With adsorption calorimetry, the heat generated by the adsorbing event is directly measured with 
											flux sensors, to record more accurate data. In addition, calorimetry allows one to measure heat of adsorption at cryogenic temps 
											which makes it possible to resolve heat of adsorption at low coverages. </p>
											
										<h3>Purpose</h3>
										<blockquote>The purpose of this research project was to evaluate the MOFs UiO-66 and UiO-66 functionalized with <i>NH<sub>2</sub></i> and 
											<i>NO<sub>2</sub></i> , to assess the effect <i>NH<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>NO<sub>2</sub></i> have on the adsorption behavior of <i>CO<sub>2</sub></i> and
											<i>CH<sub>4</sub></i>. Once these values have been experimentally measured, they will be compared to the computational values predicted 
											by the team in the WFU Physics department. My specific task was to automate the process of calculating the heat of adsorption from 50+ csv 
											files, each containing as little as 2000+ data points to as much as 6000+ data points. I used Python to accomplish this task. </blockquote>

										<!--Brief Process & Results-->
										<h3 class="major">Analysis</h3>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/plot_raw_data.png" alt="MOF" /></span> From the initial visualization of the raw data, we see that some changes need 
											to be made to allow for the use of python in calculating approximations for the area of the curve shows, particularly, the time axis. After importing the data 
											into a pandas dataframe and checking the data types of the dataframe, python recognized them as objects which does not allow us to directly convert the 
											timestamps into seconds or peform any other mathematical operations on any of the values in the dataframe. The reason we use seconds is because the thousands of 
											data points present in each of the csv files only consitute a couple of minutes at most. In the example to the right using Ethylene 50torr Trail 1, 
											the time ranges from <i>10:32:56:860</i> to <i>10:38:07:097</i>. The time format in which the data was collected is &lsquo; H:M:S:ms &rsquo; which means that the 
											time range for this csv file is about 6 minutes. Using a jupyter notebook in VS Code, I developed an algorithm that would open a folder containing the csv files 
											of various trials, read in the data into a pandas dataframe and output an initial visualization after which some conversions take place that copy the data  first 
											into a list and then an array. Finally, the area was calculated using a Riemann sum to generate a left end point approximation, midpoint approximation, and right 
											end point approximation. The midpoint approximation was generated using a line i.e. slope intercept form. The results are displayed below.</p>
